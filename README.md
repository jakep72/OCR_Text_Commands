# OCR_Text_Commands
OCR_Text_Commands is a fun little tool built on top of easyocr (https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) and opencv that allows you to send commands to your computer based on keywords written on a blank piece of paper (preferably using a sharpie on white paper).         The current set of commands are very simple, but could be expanded to be a bit more complex.  Ultimately, there is probably little utility in further development.
